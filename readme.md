# Nata
**Nata** is a library for LÃ–VE that creates entity pools. It can be used in either a traditional OOP style or a simple ECS style.

See the demos folder for some examples - the shooter example uses OOP, while the platformer example uses ECS.

## Installation
To use Nata, place `nata.lua` in your project, and then add this code to your `main.lua`:
```lua
nata = require 'nata' -- if your nata.lua is in the root directory
nata = require 'path.to.nata' -- if it's in subfolders
```

## Usage - OOP style

### Creating an entity pool
```lua
pool = nata.new()
```

### Adding an entity to the pool
```lua
entity = pool:add(entity)
```
Adds an entity to the pool and returns the entity.

### Calling an event for all entities
```lua
pool:call(event, ...)
```
For each entity, this will run `entity:[event](...)` if the entity has a function called `event`. Any additional arguments passed to `pool.call` will be passed to each entity's function.

### Calling an event for a single entity
```lua
pool:callOn(entity, event, ...)
```

### Getting entities
```lua
entities = pool:get(f)
```
Returns a table containing all the entities for which `f(entity)` returns true. For example, this code will return a table with all the entities that are marked as "solid":
```lua
solidEntities = pool:get(function(entity)
  return entity.solid
end)
```
If no function is provided, `pool:get()` will return every entity.

### Sorting entities
```lua
pool:sort(f)
```
Sorts the entities according to the function `f`. This works just like `table.sort`.

### Removing entities
```lua
pool:remove(f)
```
Removes all the entities for which `f(entity)` returns true and calls the "remove" event on each entity that is removed.

## Usage - ECS style
ECS style is almost exactly the same as OOP style, except you pass a list of systems to nata.
```lua
pool = nata.new(systems)
```
Each system is a table with an optional filter function and a function for each event it should respond to. Each event function will receive an entity first, followed by any additional arguments passed to `pool.call`, `pool.callOn`, `pool.add`, or `pool.remove`. For example, a gravity system might look like this:
```lua
GravitySystem = {
  filter = function(entity)
    return entity.vy and entity.gravity
  end,
  update = function(entity, dt)
    entity.vy = entity.vy + entity.gravity * dt
  end,
}
```
Nata's OOP functionality is implemented as a single system that passes every event (except for "filter" and "add") to the entity. If you want to use this system in combination with other systems, add `nata.oop` to the `systems` table.
